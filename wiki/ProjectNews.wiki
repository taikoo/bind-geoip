==Version 1.3 Released (2009.12.18)==

This has been tested under IPv4 load, but the IPv6 support has not been stress-tested.  Please give it a try and let us know!

==Version 1.3 (2009.12.14)==

To gain better parity with existing geo-location patches, we will be adding the following features into 1.3:

  * Basic IPv6 support
  * Backwards-compatibility for `country_*;` format from the geodns (and derived) patch.

We're aiming for a 2009.12.18 release.
