==Patch updated for 9.8.0 (2011.03.16)==

Patch updated only to bump the version and create a new clean diff.  Tested successfully in production.

==Patch updated for 9.7.2-P2 (2010.11.10)==

Patch updated only to bump the version.  Tested successfully in production.

==Patch updated for 9.7.1-P2 (2010.07.15)==

Another simple update to apply cleanly to 9.7.1-P2.  No other changes were made, and 9.7.1+ have been tested successfully.  This also seems to apply to 9.6.x with no fuzz (and the harmless "version" conflict).

==Patch updated for 9.6.1-P3 (2010.01.19)==

Simply updated the patch to apply to the 9.6.1-P3 version string (instead of 9.6.1-P2).  No other changes were made, and 9.6.1-P3 has been tested successfully.

==Version 1.3 Released (2009.12.18)==

This has been tested under IPv4 load, but the IPv6 support has not been stress-tested.  Please give it a try and let us know!

==Version 1.3 (2009.12.14)==

To gain better parity with existing geo-location patches, we will be adding the following features into 1.3:

  * Basic IPv6 support
  * Backwards-compatibility for `country_*;` format from the geodns (and derived) patch.

We're aiming for a 2009.12.18 release.
